# Pokemon-Battle-Simulator-Game

In this project I will be replicating a wild Pokemon battle. 

I will be adding the main three types: Fire, Water, and Grass. There will be an options to run away, attack, or defend. 

For this project I will be using the front-end coding languages HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
